I get enough exercise pushing my luck
I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I dont know the answer
I refuse to have a battle of wits with an opponent so clearly unarmed
According to my mirror I am pregnant and the father is Nutella
I speak fluent ironic with a solid sarcastic accent
The best part of going to work is coming back home at the end of the day
The first five days after the weekend are the toughest
The first five days after the weekend are the toughest
Math class is like watching a foreign movie without subtitles
Life is a bowl of soup and I am a fork
If you are not supposed to eat at night why is there a light bulb in the fridge
My brain has too many tabs open
